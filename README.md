topic-stability
===============

### Summary
Despite the diversity of topic modeling algorithms that have been proposed, a common challenge in successfully applying these techniques is the selection of an appropriate number of topics for a given corpus. Choosing too few topics will produce results that are overly broad, while choosing too many will result in the over-clustering of a corpus into many small, highly-similar topics. We have developed a term-centric stability analysis approach to address this issue, the idea being that a model with an appropriate number of topics will be more robust to perturbations in the data. Details of this approach are described in the paper:

This repository contains a Python reference implementation of the above approach.
